Download the UBUNTU mini .iso such as the 12.10 "quantal"

$ wget archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu/dists/quantal/main/installer-i386/current/images/netboot/mini.iso --output-document=UBUNTU-12.10-i386-mini.iso

Burn to CD or use UNetBootin.net to write to a USB key.

Put the media in the target machine and reboot.

You may need to enter the BIOS to change the "Boot Order".
You might be able to press F12 to bring-up a "Boot Menu".

During the install, most of the default settings are fine (if you are English), but make sure to uncheck any 'suggested packages' near the end of the install.

If you installed from USB, may need to run
$ grub-install /dev/sda
$ sudo update-grub

See ./install for the next step

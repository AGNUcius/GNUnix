;;; Commentary:

;; dired-efap.el allows the user to edit the filename at point, by
;; hitting a key (like f2) or double-clicking it. The name is edited
;; in the dired buffer, and the renaming takes effect when the user
;; hit the RET key. Only the name of the file at point is tangible and
;; editable, and it uses an special font.
;;
;; This package is an attempt to provide the same user interface to
;; renaming files that some graphical file managers offer.
;;
;; Please, don't confuse dired-efap with wdired package, which I also
;; wrote. Both "packages" provide alternative ways of renaming for
;; dired users, but, while they are both compatible between them, they
;; are oriented to different kind of users. wdired is for users who
;; like the incredible flexibility and power of Emacs editing
;; features. dired-efap is for users that are habituated to use other
;; graphical file managers (or "explorers", however they are called).
;;
;; The idea for this file was originated from a suggestion from Eli
;; Tziperman to improve wdired.
;;
;; Comments, bug reports, etc. welcomed

;;; Usage:

;; Add this file (byte-compile it if you want) to your load-path and
;; this line to your config (I've choose f2 because is used in some
;; file explorers, but you can change it if you want):
;; 
;; (require 'dired-efap)
;; (define-key dired-mode-map [f2] 'dired-efap)
;;
;; To edit a name you can hit f2 (or the key you chose) or
;; double-click over it. Pressing RET the file is actually renamed.
;; C-g aborts.
;;
;; The behavior of the mouse can be customized. There are three
;; options: double-click to edit, click once in the file where the
;; cursor is (this includes double-click, because the first click
;; moves the cursor) and no use the mouse to edit names. See and
;; customize the variable `dired-efap-use-mouse' to change the default
;; behavior of double-click to edit
;;
;; You can customize also the face of the name being edited. This face
;; is called `dired-efap-face'
;;
;; Type M-x customize-group RET dired-efap if you want make changes to
;; the default behavior.

;;; Change Log:

;; From 0.2 to 0.3
;;
;; - Now, edited filenames get highlighted when the mouse is over
;;   them, just like any other filename.
;;
;; - Now, the filename being edited doesn't get highlighted when the
;;   mouse is over it.
;;
;; - Now, the default `dired-efap-face' for emacs 20.x users is like
;;   it used to be in 0.1.

;; From 0.2 to 0.3
;;
;; - Now, user is warned before overwriting another file.
;;
;; - Now, when editing filename at point, clicking out of it with the
;;   mouse, but in the same buffer (_even_ _after_ the _end_ of the
;;   _text_ :-)), works as pressing RET and then clicking the mouse (i.e.
;;   the renaming is done).
;;
;; - Now, `dired-efap-select-whole-filename' works as supposed when in
;;   `transient-mark-mode' when using the keyboard.

;; From 0.1 to 0.2
;;
;; - Bug fixed: now the last filename can be edited.
;;
;; - `dired-efap-mode-hooks' and `dired-efap-load-hooks' have been
;;   added, and they are run in the right places.
;;
;; - Now, if you are using emacs 21 (or greater, :-)), the default
;;   face is a black bordered box.
;;
;; - Now, customizing `dired-efap-select-whole-filename', you can
;;   choose if the whole filename gets automatically selected when
;;   entering in `dired-efap-mode'. This can be nice to some
;;   `pc-selection-mode' users.
;;
;; - Now, when editing filename at point, clicking out of it with the
;;   mouse, but in the same buffer, works as pressing RET and then
;;   clicking the mouse (i.e. the renaming is done)

;;; Bugs

;; - A minor one: `dired-efap-select-whole-filename' doesn't work as
;;   supposed when in `transient-mark-mode' when using the mouse: the
;;   selection goes from the point where the user clicked to the end
;;   of the filename. Does anybody know why?.

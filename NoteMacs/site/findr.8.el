;; Commentary:

;; This code contains a command, called `findr', which allows you to
;; search for a file breadth-first.  This works on UNIX, Windows, and
;; over the network, using efs and ange-ftp. It's pretty quick, and (at
;; times) is a better and easier alternative to other mechanisms of
;; finding nested files, when you've forgotten where they are.

;; You pass `findr' a regexp, which must match the file you're looking
;; for, and a directory, and then it just does its thing:

;; M-x findr <ENTER> ^my-lib.p[lm]$ <ENTER> c:/ <ENTER>

;; If called interactively, findr will prompt the user for opening the
;; found file(s).  Regardless, it will continue to search, until
;; either the search is complete or the user quits the search.
;; Regardless of the exit (natural or user-invoked), a findr will
;; return a list of found matches.


;; Entrypoints and .emacs setup suggestion:
;; (autoload 'findr "findr" "Find file name." t)
;; (define-key global-map [(meta control S)] 'findr)

;; (autoload 'findr-search "findr" "Find text in files." t)
;; (define-key global-map [(meta control s)] 'findr-search)

;; (autoload 'findr-query-replace "findr" "Replace text in files." t)
;; (define-key global-map [(meta control r)] 'findr-query-replace)


;; Change Log:

;; 0.1: Added prompt to open file, if uses so chooses, following
;;      request and code example from Thomas Plass.
;; 0.2: Made `findr' not stop after the first match, based on the
;;      request by Thomas Plass.
;;      Also, fixed a minor bug where findr was finding additional
;;      files that were not correct matches, based on
;;      `file-relative-name' misuse (I had to add the 2nd arg to it).
;; 0.3: Added a `sit-for' for redisplay reasons.
;;      Modifications as suggested by RMS: e.g. docstring.
;; 0.4  Added `findr-query-replace', courtesy of Dan Nelsen.
;; 0.5  Fixed spelling and minor bug in `findr-query-replace' when
;;      non-byte-compiled.
;; 0.6  http://groups.google.com/groups?selm=cxjhfml4b2c.fsf_-_%40acs5.bu.edu :
;; From: David Bakhash (cadet@bu.edu)

;; This is the only article in this thread
;; View: Original Format
;; Newsgroups: gnu.emacs.sources
;; Date: 1999/07/31
;; Courtesy of Dan Nelsen, this version has search-and-replace capabilities.
;; it's still a bit experimental, so I wouldn't expect too much of it.  But it
;; hasn't been tested yet for friendly behavior.

;; The function `findr-query-replace' wasn't working unless you byte-compile the
;; file.  But, since findr is really designed for speed, that's not a bad thing
;; (i.e. it forces you to byte-compile it).  It's as simple as:

;; M-x byte-compile-file <ENTER> /path/to/findr.el <ENTER>

;; anyhow, I think it should work now.

;; ---- the next few versions are from Patrick Anderson:
;; 0.7 Added `findr-search', broke `findr'

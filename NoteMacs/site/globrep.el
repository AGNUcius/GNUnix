;; Cool!

;; It turns out that I only had to merge the "win32 drive:/path" part.
;; The rest is only relevant to very old versions of Emacs and XEmacs.

;; That is the main difference between the version you had and the new
;; version.  The new version is no longer so incestuous.  It also has a
;; new name (globrep.el).

;; Let me know if this works for you (a context diff between what you
;; have and the new version would be too big).

;;
;; Thanks to Justin Gordon <justin@mcm.com> for doing the conversion
;; to XEmacs (with the help of Ben Wing):
;;
;;   Here are the converted emacs files. Special thanks to Ben who
;;   provided me the XEmacs equivalents of read-event and
;;   listify-key-sequence: Use `next-command-event' for read-event and
;;   `character-to-event' for listify-key-sequence. character-to-event
;;   converts a single key chord.  This function might not be
;;   necessary, however, because `next-command-event' returns more
;;   sensible things than `read-event' does.
;;
;; Thanks to Gary Oberbrunner <garyo@avs.com> for providing the
;; global-replace-use-vc variable:
;;
;;   I don't know if you are still maintaining globrep.el, but I made
;;   some changes to it to allow it to ignore VC.  This is important
;;   when the VC backend is CVS, since CVS doesn't need checkouts.
;;   Without these changes, globrep confuses CVS quite badly.
;;
;; Thanks to Franklin Lee <flee@lehman.com> for providing the idea for
;; the NT port:
;;
;; Dear M. Boyer,
;;
;;   Please excuse my lack of French in thanking you for writing
;;   global-replace!
;;
;;   I am using it with Win NT/95 emacs v 19.34, and patched it a bit
;;   to comply with the version of compile.el.  I also discovered
;;   that, due to the idiotic filesystem conventions those
;;   dos-descendants, that the version of global replace doesn't work
;;   without another patch!  so...  I have included below my version
;;   of global-replace which works with v 19.34 on sun AND winnt
;;   versions of emacs.  In particular, the patch to
;;   global-replace-lines marked 'win32' takes care of the extra ':'
;;   character for drive letters in Windows pathnames, e.g.,
;;
;;       g:/devtools.32/lisp/foo.el: 34: blah blah
;;
;;   doesn't get completely chewed up!


;;; DESCRIPTION AND USAGE
;;;
;; This program can be used to search for and replace strings in
;; multiple files.  The idea is to find, in a set of files, all the
;; lines that contain a string to be changed.  Then, one can edit
;; the result of this search, and the program will take care of the
;; tedious task of splicing the changes back into the original files.
;;
;; The search operation can be done separately, before calling any
;; command in this file.  The output of the search has be be in a
;; special format and, indeed, there is an emacs command that does
;; that for you; see the description of the grep command (C-h f grep
;; [RET]).
;;
;; Once you have the list of interesting lines in a "grep" buffer, you
;; can edit it in any way you like, under the following conditions:
;;
;;      1. The file names and line numbers are not edited.
;;      2. Lines can be deleted altogether, in which case
;;     the program will not attempt to put them back in
;;     the original files.
;;      3. A single line can be replaced by multiple lines if carriage
;;     returns (^M) are used to delimit the end of a line.  In
;;     other words, the program replaces all '\r' by '\n' just
;;     before putting the edited lines back in place.
;;
;; The last step is to call global-replace-lines.  This command will
;; prompt you for every line in the "grep" buffer -- even those that
;; you didn't edit, asking if you want to carry to the original file
;; the change you made on that line.  You will also be offerred to
;; quit or to perform all replacements without confirmation.  Since a
;; large number of files may be involved, the command will also ask
;; you if you want to dispose of a buffer after all processing has
;; been completed on that buffer.
;;
;; Finally, the command can also present a preformatted "ChangeLog"
;; entry, saving you some time in keeping the ChangeLog file up to
;; date.
;;
;; If you prefer, there are two commands that can call grep for you,
;; and then proceed to carry out the changes.  global-grep-and-replace
;; will prompt you for original and replacement strings, and for a
;; list of files.  It will then call grep, allow you to inspect and
;; modify the result, and then will preform the actual replacements.
;; global-replace is similar, but will skip the inspection stage.
;;
;; You may wish to examine the documentation of the query.el library.
;; But if you don't, here's the short story: whenever you are prompted
;; and a set of possible answers appear between [brackets], the first
;; is always the default.
;;
;;
;; This program differs from tags-query-replace in the following ways:
;;
;; 1. tags-query-replace requires a TAGS file, and not all files can
;;    be processed by etags.
;;
;; 2. Shell wildcards are more flexible that TAGS files to specify
;;    which files to process.  Anyhow, some variants of grep can take
;;    a list a files from a file, so the TAGS functionality can be
;;    duplicated.
;;
;; 3. Mainly, global-replace is more flexible in the way the
;;    replacements are done; the list of lines to be changed, along
;;    with the name of the file where they appear, is directly
;;    available in an emacs buffer.  From then on, the user can elect
;;    not to change lines from certain files, or to process certain
;;    files differently, etc.
;;
;; 4. Finally, I find it faster and easier to use, since I specify all
;;    the replacements in one operation (editing the result from
;;    grep), and then tell emacs to do the tedious job of actually
;;    putting the changes back in the files.


;;; INSTALLATION
;;;
;; Put this file somewhere in your load-path and byte-compile it.
;; Retrieve and install query.el in the same fashion.
;; Put the following lines in your .emacs:
;;
;; (autoload 'global-replace-lines "globrep"
;;           "Put back grepped lines" t)
;; (autoload 'global-replace "globrep"
;;           "query-replace across files" t)
;; (autoload 'global-grep-and-replace "globrep"
;;           "grep and query-replace across files" t)

;;; BUGS
;;;
;; `global-replace-lines' should try to preserve attributes
;; of the files it visits:
;;    don't offer to kill the buffer if it existed before the global-replace
;;    don't call vc-checkin if the checkout wasn't done by global-replace
;;
;; There should be a way to say "replace all occurrences in this buffer" or
;; "skip the rest of this buffer".  Perhaps it should even be the default.
;;
;; I don't understand very well the code in vc.el.  Consequently, VC
;; support is probably buggy.

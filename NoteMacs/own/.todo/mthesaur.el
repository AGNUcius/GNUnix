;; Introduction
;; ------------
;;
;; This package provides a way to perform a thesaurus search on a word or
;; phrase using the awesome Project Gutenberg Etext of Moby Thesaurus II
;; by Grady Ward.
;;
;; To use mthesaur, insert in your ~/.emacs:
;;
;;    (require 'mthesaur)
;;
;; Or:
;;
;;    (autoload 'mthesaur-search "mthesaur"
;;      "Thesaurus lookup of a word or phrase." t)
;;    (autoload 'mthesaur-search-append "mthesaur"
;;      "Thesaurus lookup of a word or phrase, append results." t)
;;
;; Optionally followed by assigning key sequences to the mthesaur
;; functions:
;;
;;    (global-set-key "\C-ct" 'mthesaur-search)
;;    (global-set-key "\C-c\C-t" 'mthesaur-search-append)
;;
;; In the detailed instructions below, I assume that you have assigned
;; mthesaur-search to `C-c t' and mthesaur-search-append to 'C-c C-t'.
;;
;; Be sure to modify the mthesaur-file variable to point to where you've
;; put your copy of the mthesaur.txt file.
;;
;; For good performance, be sure to byte-compile mthesaur.el, e.g.
;;
;;    M-x byte-compile-file <give the path to mthesaur.el when prompted>
;;
;; Or open the mthesaur.el file and run "Byte-Compile This File" from the
;; "Emacs-Lisp" menu.  Either way, this will generate mthesaur.elc, which
;; will be loaded instead of mthesaur.el.
;;
;; mthesaur.el was tested with GNU Emacs 21.3.1.
;;
;;
;; Using mthesaur
;; --------------
;;
;; To lookup the word at the cursor, or to lookup the phrase in the
;; marked region, type:
;;
;;    C-c t
;;
;; To be prompted to enter a word or phrase to be looked up, type:
;;
;;    C-u C-c t
;;
;; The normal history manipulation commands (M-p, M-n, etc.) work as
;; expected at the minibuffer prompt.  Even the words/phrases that were
;; added via `C-c t' will be in the history list.
;;
;; The 'C-c C-t' key sequence behaves identically to 'C-c t' except the
;; search results are appended to the end of the previous search results
;; instead of overwriting them.
